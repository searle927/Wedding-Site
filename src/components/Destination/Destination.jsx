So we thought it would be very fitting that our wedding be in one of the most beautiful places we traveled to. We suggest getting here a couple days early because we'd love to hang out and spend time with everyone before the wedding day. Please <a className="link" href="https://www.royaltonresorts.com/royalton-antigua/accommodations/chairman-overwater-bungalows">click here</a> to book your hotels if you'll be staying at the Royalton as well. <br /><br /> We are super excited to see everyone at the wedding!</h3><br />
